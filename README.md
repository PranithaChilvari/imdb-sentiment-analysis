## ðŸ§  What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that focuses on identifying emotions or opinions expressed in text. It is commonly used to determine whether a text expresses a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** attitude. In this project, we take it further by classifying tweets into four distinct categories, offering a more nuanced understanding of public opinion on climate change.


## ðŸ¤– What is BERT?

**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art language model developed by Google. Unlike earlier models that read text either left-to-right or right-to-left, BERT reads text **in both directions at once**, allowing it to better understand the context of each word.

BERT is pre-trained on a massive amount of text and can be fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets like ours. This makes it ideal for sentiment classification, where subtle differences in language matter.
